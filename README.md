# As yet untited 4x grand strategy game.

A Von-Neumann probe lands on an alien planet. However the builders of it couldn't agree on a single ideology or destiny for the planet. So many bases are built, factions formed. Do you have what it takes to thrive and grow an bend the planet to your will?

If you are interested join the discord where you'll find the links to the game development plan and can ask questions with the team. We're actively looking for developers to work on this open source project so if you like programming, pixel art, sound or marketing come and join up. :)
